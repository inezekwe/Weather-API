Mini Weather App


For today’s mini project, we are going to build a weather application. This project will have the following goals of:


1. Having you learn how to follow instructions for accessing external apis
2. Having you learn how to read documentation and incorporate into your code


The final product is that a user should be able to enter a zipcode, and from that zipcode, print out the appropriate information on screen. Please follow the steps below:


1) Register For the Free Weather API


You will be using OpenWeatherMap API to get data on weather. You can register to access the free weather API at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up . Please start by registering


2) Confirm Your Email


This step is important. Please confirm your email or your api key will not work.


3) API Key


After you have confirmed your email, you can use your appid/api key for accessing the service. Please go here to find your API Key: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys


4) API Documentation


The API will give you instructions on how to call the API. Please read through the instructions carefully on how to use their API:
https://openweathermap.org/current


5) Build Your Weather Application


From the documentation, it’s time to build your weather application from scratch! Your weather application should have the following:
1. A simple search box where a user can enter information such as a zipcode
2. When the user clicks submit, their information should be passed to the weather API per the documentation
3. When a successful response comes back from the weather API, print the weather information on screen
4. Record all the users searches and display on screen


Bonus
* Style your application
* Handle error cases where a user inputs invalid entry
